# Social Network Graph Simulation

## Overview
This project models a social network as an **undirected weighted graph**, where:
- **Nodes** represent users.
- **Edges** represent friendships or connections.
- **Weights** indicate the strength of connections based on interaction data.

It simulates and analyzes relationships, interactions, and paths between users in a social environment.

## Features
- Add/remove users and friendships.
- Assign and update connection weights.
- Perform shortest path search between users.
- Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Analyze connectivity and relationship strength.
- User-friendly interface for interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** [e.g., Python/C++/Java]
- **Data Structures:** Graph (Adjacency List/Matrix)
- **Algorithms:** BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub
